            <p> Ofada Rice </p>
            <p>Ofada rice is a name for heritage varieties of rice grown in South-west Nigeria
            <p>It is used in a variety of dishes. Ofada rices are mostly blends, and some </p>
            <p>of the rice varieties in the blends are not indigenous to Africa; however, they </p>
            <p> usually also contain African rice. It is grown almost exclusively in Ogun State,</p>
            <p>a state in Southwestern Nigeria.</p>
            <p>The grains are striped with burgundy.</p>
            <p> It is the blanket name for almost all locally produced rice.</p>
            <p> Because actually, it is named after a place, Ofada</p>
            <p> It has a peculiar flavour & taste, something ‘umami’ish’ about it.</p>
            <p>And it is highly nutritive because it is processed ‘brown’, unpolished and parboiled.</p>
